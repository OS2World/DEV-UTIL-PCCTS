             Welcome to the Advanced Tutorial for PCCTS 1.0x

This directory contains 5 makefiles--a main one and the four makefiles,
makefile.?, from the documentation.  The four ANTLR files have also been
typed in for you as are tut1.g-tut4.g.

Doing a "make -s all" will make all tutorials presented in the documentation.
A "make -f makefile.i" can be used to make the ith tutorial (it's a good idea to
do a "make scrub" before each individual make).

The makefiles assume that the tutorial has been placed in a directory at the
same level as antlr, dlg, support etc...

Good luck,
